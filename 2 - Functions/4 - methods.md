In programming, the terms "function" and "method" are often used to describe blocks of code that perform a specific task or operation. While both functions and methods serve a similar purpose, they are used in slightly different contexts and have some key differences:

**Functions:**

1. **Global Scope:**
   - Functions are blocks of code that can be defined in the global scope (i.e., not inside any specific object or class).
   - They can be accessed and called from anywhere in the program.

2. **Independent:**
   - Functions are independent units of code and are not tied to any specific object or class.
   - They can be called directly with their names.

3. **Usage:**
   - Functions are typically used for general-purpose, reusable code that performs a specific task.
   - They are commonly used for code that doesn't belong to a specific object or class.

**Example of a Function:**

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const sum = add(3, 5); // Calling the function
console.log(sum); // Output: 8
```

**Methods:**

1. **Object-Oriented:**
   - Methods are functions that are associated with objects or classes.
   - They are defined within the context of an object or class and operate on that object's data.

2. **Context:**
   - Methods are called on specific objects, and they have access to the object's properties and other methods via the `this` keyword.
   - They are used to manipulate or interact with the state of the object.

3. **Usage:**
   - Methods are commonly used in object-oriented programming (OOP) to encapsulate behavior and data within objects.
   - They represent the actions or operations that an object can perform.

**Example of a Method:**

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  fullName: function() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
};

const fullName = person.fullName(); // Calling the method on the 'person' object
console.log(fullName); // Output: 'John Doe'
```

**Key Differences:**

- Functions can exist independently in the global scope and are not tied to specific objects or classes, whereas methods are closely associated with objects and classes.
- Methods operate on the data (properties) of the object they are associated with and often use the `this` keyword to access that data.
- Functions are typically used for general-purpose, standalone operations, while methods are used to encapsulate the behavior of objects.
- Methods can be called on objects using dot notation (`object.method()`), while functions are called by name (`function()`).

In summary, functions and methods are both essential building blocks in programming, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Functions are used for general-purpose code, while methods are used to define the behavior of objects in an object-oriented paradigm.
